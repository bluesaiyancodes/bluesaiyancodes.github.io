Automated detection of subtle surface anomalies on industrial display panels using structured illumination and deep learning.

## Problem
Surface defects on display panels are often **extremely small, low-contrast, and visually similar to background noise**, making manual inspection unreliable and time-consuming.  
The goal of this project was to develop an automated pipeline capable of **detecting and localizing microscopic panel defects** under controlled illumination conditions.

Key constraints included:
- Defects occupying only a few pixels
- Strong background patterns (moving stripes, lighting artifacts)
- Severe class imbalance between defective and non-defective regions
- Requirement for high precision to avoid false alarms in production

## Approach

### Data
- Custom image acquisition setup using:
  - Fixed camera
  - Display monitor with structured illumination (white light + moving stripes)
  - Controlled background lighting
- Multiple captures of the same panel were merged to enhance defect visibility
- Two defect classes annotated using bounding boxes
- Dataset characterized by extreme foreground sparsity

### Model
- YOLO-based object detection framework for real-time defect localization
- Two-class detection setup
- SAM explored for post-processing and region refinement
- Detection focused on small-object sensitivity rather than large contextual cues

### Training
- Long-horizon training (≈400 epochs) to stabilize learning under class imbalance
- Class-wise loss monitoring to ensure balanced convergence
- Extensive filtering of false positives during early epochs
- Careful threshold tuning for confidence-based suppression

### Evaluation
- Precision and recall tracked independently for each defect class
- Qualitative inspection used as a primary validation signal due to rarity of defects
- Final models achieved stable high precision and recall after convergence

## Notes & Lessons Learned
- Structured illumination is critical: raw images without stripe modulation hide most defects
- Merging multiple frames significantly improves defect visibility
- Small-object detection is more sensitive to preprocessing than model choice
- Early training instability is expected due to extreme imbalance and sparse positives
- Classical image processing remains valuable as a complement to deep learning in industrial settings

This project emphasized **robust deployment-oriented design**, balancing detection accuracy with false-positive control under real manufacturing constraints.
